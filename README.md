## Deductions
I have reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
Note: The Atom errors in my project are from code supplied by Richard.  I chose to ignore the errors and maintain the code as it was provided to me especially since when I adjusted the errors the code did not create the desired effect.

Also, I worked on the angled drop shadow for the banner image for an additional 10 hours of research and attempts to create a match to the original project. As well, I asked for guidance. Due to my work schedule with paid clients, I am unable to continue experimenting with this idea. I would appreciate a tutorial or additional guidance. The angled drop shadow remains beyond my skill set and problem solving capabilities.

Whew! This was an intense assignment that took a lot longer than anticipated.  I continue to be grateful that I write and produce for a living.  I do not see myself re-constructing websites for others, ever! I definitely will address my personal websites over the summer and make them responsive.

I do remain grateful to be learning this content. The exercises are keeping me on my toes. My brain processes faster than it did a year ago!
